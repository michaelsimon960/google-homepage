Summary:
This is my first CSS/HTML project. The goal of this project was to build a replica of the Google homepage. Adding search functionality and working links was not necessary for this project. I mainly focused on building the page layout rather then getting all designs, fonts, text sizes, and colors to be 100% accurate. 

Future Directions:
This project helped me come to the realization that I have more to learn regarding the utilization of grids and flexboxes, and the benefits of one over the other.
